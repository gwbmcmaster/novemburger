The city of Hamilton, Ontario hosts every year during the month of November, Novemburger. There are approximately 56 different types of burgers across the City. This is an interactive Shiny App (R) that allows users to limit the different types of burgers based on price range and City location. Once the user places a price range, he/she can click on the burger icon and a popup will occur - showing the name of the Restaurant (hyperlink), price, name of burger, burger photo, and immediate directions. 

Requirements:
